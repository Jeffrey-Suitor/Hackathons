## 2019

### Deltahacks

This was a project using machine vision to identify the number of cystaline structures in an image per a challenge from the material department. We can 3rd place.

### MEC

This was about creating a predictive autocomplete using text features per the MEC challenge. We had 6 hours and we came 4th that year.

### MedHacks

We decided to create a program for identifying which teeth had been cleaned and what features were identified as these records are currently only kept on paper and digitizing this recording process would increase access to records. We did not place.

## 2020

### Deltahacks

We did another version of the materials question however, we had several team member drop out and didn't place as well as I would have liked.

### MEC

This was about creating a new food system for managing food shipments at McMaster. I no longer have the link to the Figma for this one but we came 1st place.

### OEC

This was related to managing power needs in a power grid and doing the most efficient allocation. Our group was only 3 members and we chose to make the most eco-concious choices as our group lacked the experise to excel at this challenge as we were mostly a frontend team.

## 2021

### TOHacks

This was creating a map app for local business with a better revenue split for food delivery using a provided company API. This was our first time using React-Native so we didn't make as much progress as we would have liked.
